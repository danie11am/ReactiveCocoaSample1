A simple app to illustrate the use of [ReactiveCocoa framework](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa).

It also illustrates the use of other iOS frameworks/coding practice including:

- Auto Layout
- UITabBarController
- Code-reuse by implementing subclasses
- UI done programmatically - no storyboards/nib files
