## Overview

A sample app to illustrate the use of [ReactiveCocoa framework](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa). Refer to this [blog post](http://daniellam.me/blog/adventure-to-reactivecocoa-land/) to see its screenshots, why I created it, how it works, etc.

It also illustrates the use of other iOS frameworks/coding practice including:

- Auto Layout
- UITabBarController
- Code-reuse by implementing subclasses
- UI done programmatically - no storyboards/nib files
- Using git submodule


## Running the app

1. Clone it.
2. Get the ReactiveCocoa submodule and all its submodules by running

    git submodule update --init --recursive
